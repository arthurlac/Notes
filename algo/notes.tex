\section{Two problems}
Firstly we shall look at two problems which belong to the complexity class NP.

\subsection{Traveling Sales Person}
Consider a finite set $N$ of cities; $\{1, 2 \dots n\}$. The distance, or cost,
of traveling between cities $i$ and $j$ is given by $D(i,j)$ where $D$
is a symmetric matrix.

$$\forall\ i, j\quad D(i,J) \in \mathbb{N}\quad D(i,j) = D(j,i)$$

The problem is to find a path, or permutation, of
cities where each city appears exactly once in the path and the total
cost is minimised.

The brute force solution is to consider all paths, doing this would require
considering $!n$ paths.

\subsection{Boolean Formula Satisfiability}
A boolean formula consists of the logical binary operators $(\land, \lor, \neg)$
and a finite set of variables $X$ where each variable can be either true or false.
The problem consists of deciding if there exists a set of values for the variables $X$
which results in the boolean formula being true.

$$(x_1 \land x_2) \land \neg x_3$$

$$(x_1 \land x_2) \land \neg x_1$$

A brute force solution would be to consider all $2^{|X|}$ possible assignments.

The link between these two problems is the na\"ive brute force solution is not
tractable for large values of $n$.

\section{NP-Complete problems}
\begin{definition}
	$\mathcal{L}$ is \textit{NP-Complete} if
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mathcal{L} \in NP$
		\item $\forall\ \mathcal{L\prime} \in NP\ \mathcal{L\prime} \propto \mathcal{L}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

What does this definition mean?
Any two NP-complete languages are polynomially equivalent.
Any NP-Complete problem is at least as hard as any other problem in NP.

\begin{theorem}
	Given two languages $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T} \in NP$,
	if $\mathcal{S} \in NPC$ and $\mathcal{S} \propto \mathcal{T}$ then
	$\mathcal{T} \in NPC$.
\end{theorem}

This theorem is rather useful for proving that a language is NP-Complete,
however it leaves us with the issue of proving a first language is NP-Complete.

\begin{definition}
	A boolean formula $F$ is in \textit{conjunctive normal form} if it is in the form
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F &= f_1 \land f_2 \dots \land f_n \\
		f_i &= y_1 \lor y_2 \dots \lor y_m \\
		y_j &= x\ |\ \neg x
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

The following is in conjunctive normal form:
$$(x_1 \lor x_2) \land \neg x_3$$
The following is not in conjunctive normal form;
however it is in \textit{disjunctive normal form}
$$(x_1 \lor x_2) \lor \neg x_3$$
This is because there is the negation on the left hand side of the logical or.

\begin{definition}
	Given an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}$ which is a pair of vertices and edges $(V,E)$,
	a subset of vertices $S \subset V$ is a \textit{clique} iff
	$$\forall\ x, y \in S\ \exists\ \textrm{an edge}\ (x,y) \in E$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	If $S$ is a clique in $\mathcal{G}$ and $|S| = q$ then $S$ is called a \textit{$q$-clique}.
\end{definition}

An obvious consequence of this definition is that for any edge $(x,y)$ there is a 2-clique.

\begin{definition}
	The \textit{$q$-clique problem} is finding if there exists a $q$-clique in a given graph
	$\mathcal{G}$ where $q \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}
