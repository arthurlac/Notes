\section{What is the problem}
Cryptography allows for the secure exchange of information.
It is important to begin by noting that cryptography does not mean security.
What cryptography does is provide us \textit{primitives} for security; it also
allows us to analyse how secure we are being.

\subsection{Areas of cryptography}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Encryption - Only the intended recipient can understand the message.
  \item Steganography - Only the intended recipient is aware that there is a message.
  \item Chaffing and winnowing - Only the intended recipient can find the real message.
\end{itemize}

We will focus on encryption.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Confidentiality
  \item Data integrity
  \item Authentication
  \item Message Authentication
  \item Signature
  \item Certification
  \item Non-repudiation
  \item Revocation
\end{itemize}
