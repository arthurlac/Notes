\section{What is the problem}
Cryptography allows for the secure exchange of information.
It is important to begin by noting that cryptography does not mean security.
What cryptography does is provide us \textit{primitives} for security; it also
allows us to analyse how secure we are being.

\subsection{Areas of cryptography}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Encryption - Only the intended recipient can understand the message.
  \item Steganography - Only the intended recipient is aware that there is a message.
  \item Chaffing and winnowing - Only the intended recipient can find the real message.
\end{itemize}

We will focus on encryption.

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidentiality: Keeping information a secret from those not authorised to have it.
	\item Data integrity: Ensuring information has not been altered by those not authorised to do so.
	\item Authentication: Confirmation of the identity of an entity.
	\item Message authentication: Confirmation of the source of information.
	\item Signature: A way of binding information to an entity.
	\item Certification: Endorsement of information by a trusted entity.
	\item Non-repudiation: Preventing an entity from denying previous actions or commitments.
	\item Revocation: Retracting certification or authorisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cryptosystem}
\begin{definition}
	A \textit{cryptosystem} (or encryption system) is a five-tuple $(P,C,K,E,D)$, where
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $P$ is a finite set of possible plaintexts
		\item $C$ is a finite set of possible ciphertexts
		\item $K$ is a finite set of possible keys called the keyspace
		\item For each key $k \in K$
			there is an encryption rule $e_k \in E$ where $e_k : P \rightarrow C$
			and a corresponding decryption rule where $d_k \in D$, $d_k : C \rightarrow P$
			such that
			$$\forall\ x \in P\ d_k(e_k(x)) = x$$
		\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For a cryptosystem to be useful in practice, we need:
1. to be able to efficiently compute the encryption and the decryption functions
2. that an unauthorised party should not be able to determine the key or the plaintext
We also need each encryption function ek to be injective or one to one. Why?

\section{Classical Cryptography}
\begin{definition}
	The \textit{subsitution cipher} has
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P = C = \Z_{26}$
		\item $K$ is the set of all permutations of $\Z_{26}$
		\item
			$
			\forall\ \pi \in K
			\ e_\pi(x) = \pi(x) = y
			\ d_\pi(y) = \pi^{-1}(y) = x
			$
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

	The \textit{shift cipher}, also called the Caesar cipher,

	The \textit{permutation cipher}

\subsection{Security}
\subsubsection{Computational security}
A cryptosystem is computationally secure if the best algorithm for breaking it requires a com- putational effort which is greater than the computational resources of the assumed attacker.
• We need a measure of the computational effort to break the cryptosystem. • We can’t prove a system is computationally secure against all attacks.

\subsubsection{Provable security}
For some cryptosystems that provide confidentiality we can provide evidence that the system is secure by proving a theorem of the form:
If the cryptosystem can be broken then we can efficiently solve problem A, where problem A is
 Well studied
 Thought to be “difficult”
This is not an absolute proof of security but a proof of the security relative to another problem.

\subsubsection{Unconditional security}
A cryptosystem is said to be unconditionally secure if an attacker with infinite computational resources cannot break the system.

\begin{definition}
	\textit{Vernam cipher}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	\textit{One time pad}
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{An unconditionally secure cryptosystem}
In 1949 Shannon proved that the one-time pad is unconditionally secure.
Theorem 1.
%%Suppose (P, C, K, E, D) is a cryptosystem where |K| = |C| = |P|. Then the cryptosystem provides perfect secrecy if and only if every key is used with equal probability 1/|K|, and for everyx∈P andeveryy∈C,thereisauniquekeysuchthatek(x)=y.
(as stated in Cryptography Theory and Practice)

\subsubsection{Unconditional security is not practical}

Instead of aiming for unconditional security researchers have tried to develop cryptosystems where one shared key can be used to send many messages between to entities while still main- taining computational security.

\section{Cryptographic Hashes}

We will consider the use of cryptographic hashes for
firstly \textit{message digest codes (MDC)}.
MDC allows us to
Here we use \textit{un-keyed hashes}.
Secondly we will use CHF for \textit{message authentication codes (MAC)}
Here we use \textit{keyed hashes}.

\textit{Hash functions} are functions which
map data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size,
the output being called a hash.
To qualify as hash functions these functions must have several qualities;
firstly that the function \textit{compresses} the input,
the output must always be the same size.
Secondly the function must be "easy" to compute;
i.e. computable algorithmically in polynomial time
with no massive hidden constants.

\textit{Cryptographic hash functions} are a subset of hash functions
for which given $h(x) = y$ it is easy to verify that $h(x)$ is $y$
but given just $y$ it is not easy to find $x$.

More formally we have
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\X$ is the set of messages.
	\item $\Y$ is the finite set of hashes,
		where each hash is of fixed size $n$ such that
		$\forall\ y \in \Y\ |y| = n$.
	\item $h : \X \rightarrow \Y$ is the hash function.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
	A \textit{un-keyed hash function}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \textit{keyed hash function} is the tuple $(\X,\Y,\K,\Hsh)$ where
\end{definition}

A hash function is considered to be secure if three problems are difficult to solve.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Preimage 1}
		Given $h : \X \rightarrow \Y$
		and $y \in Y$
		find $x \in X$
		such that $h(x) = y$.
	\item \textit{Preimage 2}
		Given $h : \X \rightarrow \Y$
		and $x \in \X$
		find $x\prime \in \X\ x \neq x\prime$
		such that $h(x) = h(x\prime)$.
	\item \textit{Collision}
		Given only $h : \X \rightarrow \Y$
		find $x, x\prime \in \X$
		such that $x \neq x\prime, h(x) = h(x\prime)$.
\end{itemize}

Birthday attack problem

Summarily, a hash function is secure if
a preimage attack requires $2^n$ operations and
a collision attack requires attack $2^{n/2}$ operations.
